# Rust By Example 
This repository will contain the code examples which I practiced during my initial learning of rust language.  
The official website of rust is given in [2].  
I use docker image for rust. [1] However, I do always suggest to setup rust in your own mechine. check [2] to find out how to setup on your local mechine.
